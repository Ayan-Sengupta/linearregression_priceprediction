Only looking at Asheville NC

A linear regression model to predict the price of Airbnb listings in Asheville, NC. 

Structure:
1) Data directory contains all data sets being used (initial and processed)
2) src directory contains all steps from cleaning to training and testibng the model. Each step is a python script with the name of the step being performed
3) main.py is the intended entry point to the project but each individual step (script) can also be executed individually for debugging purposes
